## Design Philosophy

We believe that great design is more than just aesthetics—it's about creating experiences that are both beautiful and functional. Our components are built with these principles in mind:

### 1. Simplicity

Components should be easy to understand and use, without sacrificing functionality. We focus on clean, intuitive interfaces that feel natural to users.

### 2. Accessibility

Every component is designed to be accessible from the start, ensuring your applications work for everyone, regardless of how they interact with the web.

### 3. Flexibility

While we provide beautiful default styles, every component is customizable to match your brand identity and specific needs.

### 4. Performance

Components are optimized for performance, ensuring smooth interactions and fast loading times across all devices.
